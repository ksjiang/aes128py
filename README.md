# aes128py
Quick homebrew AES-128 encryption/decryption

Advanced Encryption Standard Rijndael 128-bit encryption/decryption algorithm

Code created for the sole purpose of solving a CTF challenge. DO NOT use for commercial / production purposes as this is very insecure.

A highly-optimized x86 version of this coming to a theater near you soon!

Encode takes an ASCII string and a base64 key, outputting a base64 ciphertext. Decode takes a base64 ciphertext and base64 key, outputting an ASCII string.

Enjoy!
